## Overview


The program allows for the user to predict the winner of the superbow using complex algolrythims and forecasting tools. 

---

## Requirements

This project leverages python 3.7 Streamlit and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn

This project leverages python 3.7, Streamlit, Yahoo Finance, SciPy, ARIMA and Statsmodels .

Go to your terminal or git bash and run conda activate dev to activate your conda dev environment. 
You will then install the following librarie(s) and module(s) to run in Python codes created.
    pip install streamlit
    pip install yahoo-finance
    pip install scipy
    pip install pmdarima
    pip install statsmodels

To ensure installation was complete, run the following...
    conda list streamlit
    conda list yahoo-finance
    conda list scipy
    conda list pmdarima
    conda list statsmodels

## Data

The data used in this neural network model was from derived from a CSV file called ???.csv:

---

## Usage

Go to the Anaconda Prompt to launch JupyterLab by typing Jupyter Lab. To use this application simply clone the repository and run the ???.py in you Jupyter Lab Notebook. Open a terminal and input streamlit run main.py or click on ??? to experience the app.
