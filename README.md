This project leverages python 3.7 Streamlit and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn

This project leverages python 3.7, Streamlit, Yahoo Finance, SciPy, ARIMA and Statsmodels .

Go to your terminal or git bash and run conda activate dev to activate your conda dev environment. 
You will then install the following librarie(s) and module(s) to run in Python codes created.
    pip install streamlit
    pip install sportsreference
    pip install sportsipy

To ensure installation was complete, run the following...
    conda list streamlit
    conda list sportsrefernce
    conda list sportsipy
