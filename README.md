## Executive Summary

Praedico is an online application that allows our users to fair a better chance of predicting the winner in the NFL game of football. Without a doubt the value of the NFL betting market is challenging to accurately estimate. The value of the sports betting market is anywhere between 700 Billion to 1 Trillion with an illegal market estimated at 500 Billion. If your goal is to make money, we can help you achieve that goal with a higher probabilty.

In our application, we have broken down the code into three steps. 
Step 1: Gathering, cconcatenating and cleaning the data using offensive and defensive categories throughout multiple years.
Step 2: Training and testing the data using logistic regression, adaboost...
Step 3: Combining the machine leaning to forecast the ultimate winner of the Suberbowl

Thank you for using our application. We look forward to winning with you. May the Praedico be with you!

## Requirements


This project leverages python 3.7 Streamlit and scikit-learn.

A [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment with liabraries listed below and [Jupyter Notebook/Lab](https://jupyter.org/) are required to run the code.

The following library was used:

1. [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) - Scikit Learn or Sklearn is one of the most used Python libraries for Data Science, along with others like Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, or Keras.


Install the following librarie(s) in your terminal...

    pip install -U scikit-learn

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This project leverages python 3.7, Streamlit, Yahoo Finance, SciPy, ARIMA and Statsmodels .
=======
The CSV files used in our codes were mainly created from https://pro-football-reference.com
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Go to your terminal or git bash and run conda activate dev to activate your conda dev environment. 
You will then install the following librarie(s) and module(s) to run in Python codes created.
